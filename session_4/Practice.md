### Practice Qn:

1. Missing number in array

   - Ex: Input:
     N = 4
     A[] = {1,2,3,5}
     Output: 4

2. Find duplicates in an array

   - Ex: Input:
     N = 4
     a[] = {0,3,1,2}
     Output: -1
     Explanation: N=4 and all elements from 0
     to (N-1 = 3) are present in the given
     array. Therefore output is -1.

3. Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

   - Ex: Input:
     N = 5
     arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
     Output:
     0 0 1 2 2
     Explanation:
     0s 1s and 2s are segregated
     into ascending order.

4. Majority Element

   - Ex: Input:
     N = 3
     A[] = {1,2,3}
     Output:
     -1
     Explanation:
     Since, each element in
     {1,2,3} appears only once so there
     is no majority element.

5. Peak element
   - Description: An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
     Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
     Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.
   - Ex: Input:
     N = 3
     arr[] = {1,2,3}
     Possible Answer: 2
     Generated Output: 1
     Explanation: index 2 is 3.
     It is the peak element as it is
     greater than its neighbour 2.
     If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.
